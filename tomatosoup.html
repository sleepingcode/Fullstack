    <h3>Ingredients needed:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can tomatoes, we prefer to use whole peeled or crushed, see notes for fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 large onion, cut into large wedges</li>
        <li>1/2 cups water, low sodium vegetable stock, or chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. fine sea salt, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven or large saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add onion wedges, water, can of tomatoes with their juices, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer.
            <br>
            Cook, uncovered, for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally and add additional salt as needed.
        </li>
        <li>Blend the soup, and then season to taste. The soup doesnâ€™t need to be ultra-smooth, some texture is a nice
            touch. <br> An immersion blender does make quick work of this, or you can use a blender. If you use a
            regular
            blender, it is best to blend in batches and <br> not fill the blender as much as you usually would since the
            soup
            is so hot. We like to remove the center insert of the lid and cover it with a kitchen towel while
            blending
            this helps to release some of the steam and prevents the blender lid from popping off (which can be a big,
            hot mess).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        And that's it! A simple, quick and easy recipe for creamy tomato soup!
