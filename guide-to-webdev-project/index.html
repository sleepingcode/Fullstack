        What <em>exactly </em>is a computer programmer? Computer programmers write code. They write code to design
        programs. This may sound vague, but computer programming is a vast field with many different specializations. In
        order to effectively include all of the database managers, web developers, systems analysts, and application
        devs, it is easier to group them under the umbrella of “computer programmers.”</p>

        If you love writing code, computer programming might be for you. In this article we'll discuss steps it takes to

        Coders don't necessarily have to be professionals to be considered computer programmers. There are plenty of
        hobbyists out there that, according to our definition of computer programming, make the grade. Even so, we'll
        focus on the path to finding a computer programming career.

    <blockquote>If your aim is to be a hobby programmer, you'll still need a plan and an education, but you'll probably
        have different goals past those points.</blockquote>
